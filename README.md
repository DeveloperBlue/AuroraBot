## AuroraBot
A node.js bot build using the discord.js library. Caters to just one server (My own) for messing around with friends. Quirky, has no chat functions, and was built with no scalability or stability in mind. This is simply a messy project for experimentation and fun. Has a ridiculous amount of unmet dependencies and your normal abundance of '-npm install's

### User Code
The index.js file contains all the user-end code for the bot. Everything else is node js dependencies, npm packages, and their myriad of dependencies.

### Discord.js API
[Here is the Discord js API I used to build AuroraBot ontop of Node js.](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome)

### Notes
* **index.js** contains the user-code
* For a list of all *documented* commands, type **!cmds** assuming **!** is set as the trigger prefix. *(Default)*

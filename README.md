## AuroraBot
A node.js bot build using the discord.js library. Capable of serving a small number of servers, generally used for messing around with friends. Quirky, has no chat functions, and was built with no scalability or stability in mind. This is simply a messy project for experimentation and fun. Has a ridiculous amount of unmet dependencies and your normal abundance of '-npm install's
Does not use any sort of sharding. Currently serving 2 personal servers and 1 team server.

### User Code
The index.js file contains all the user-end code for the bot. Everything else is node js dependencies, npm packages, and their myriad of dependencies.

### Discord.js API
[Here is the Discord js API I used to build AuroraBot ontop of Node js.](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome)

### Notes
* **index.js** contains the user-code
* For a list of all *documented* commands, type **!cmds** assuming **!** is set as the trigger prefix. *(Default)*
